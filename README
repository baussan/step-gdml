When in doubt, read the source.

# visual.py

Requires pythonOCC (http://www.pythonocc.org/).
QT should be available and integrated with pyOCC.

Tested with:
*   pythonOCC: v 0.8.0 (opensuse), really 0.6dev.

Very in progress.

# step-gdml.py

Requires FreeCAD (http://freecadweb.org/).

Tested with:
*   FreeCAD 0.14 Revision: 3702
*   FreeCAD 0.12 Revision: 5382

Should work with all versions in between.

Because FreeCAD may not be in your python import
search path by default, you need to provide a path
as a command line argument. If the executable is
in "path/to/FreeCAD/bin/FreeCAD", just use the lib
folder "path/to/FreeCAD/lib". It should work.

Largely complete.
