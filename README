# Step-gdml

A project to convert STEP files to GDML files in a clean and fast fashion.
Requires OpenCASCADE (tested with 6.50, 6.71) and Qt 4 (tested with 4.8.4).

To build:

Run:
> qmake step-gdml.pro
> make

Errors may occur if $CASROOT can not be found. Either set it to
the root location of OpenCASCADE or edit step-gdml.pro.

Note: project still relies on a shim from Geant4 IESample.
